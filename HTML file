    <h1>2021 Made Me</h1>
    <p>

 
2021 made me wonder why did this have to happen?<br>
Why does the world have periods of time when it is in turmoil.<br> It made me wonder reflect on my past and compare and contrast this era with the “normal era” where life was like rain but now it was mixing between sleet and snow and I was overloading.<br>

2021 made me hope.<br> Hope for a better future.<br> Hope for a future for no pandemonium and masks and social distancing and all that rubbish.<br> It made me hope for a better future where my descendants will live happier than me right now.<br>

2021 made me grateful.<br> Grateful for my past and living normally and no masks etc.<br> it made me grateful for an era where not an increased amount of deaths because believe me if I had a time machine I would go back to September 2019 and find the source of all the pandemonium and destroy it like I would destroy professor Umbridge from the harry potter series with that annoying little pink handbag and that evil toadish smile.<br> 

2021 made me brave because even amidst all the chaos I still rebuilt and stayed sane(somehow).<br> staying sane in 2021 was like sinking my teeth into my uncle’s pancakes, painful and exhausting.<br>

2021 you are a shadow of 2020 but you are still part of an era I shall remember as a world in disarray so go away.<br>

2022 I am excited to see what you can offer because you have many promises such as no pandemic and no chaos and pandemonium and turmoil and mayhem and as many synonyms for chaos as you can think of.<br> I am counting on you.
